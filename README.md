Greenhouse
==========

Greenhouse project about measuring various values like temperature, humidity etc. and sending collected data to the cloud. Outcome of the project is learning how to code microcontroller to communicate with the cloud, practise mesh wireless network and pico-power wireless sensors design

List of sensors used in the project:
----------

- Digital temeprature sensor [Dallas DS1920]
- Digital humidity sensor [SHT-22]
- Digital light sensor
- Digital UV light sensor
- DIgital barometric pressure sensor
